**TODO**s:

- Feature, onset detection, and spectrum wrapping in `track`
- Specshow multiplots wrapping in `track`
- New methods for splitting and subinfo
- Seperation added in stamp to form `properties` attr group
- Build personal databases

librosa` Utils:

- Laplacian Segmentation for Measure and Chapter Splitting
- Vocal, Harmonic, and Percussive Seperation
- VHP 3d modeling, chroma, MFCC
- Beats, tempo, superflux onsets

`torch` Adaptives:

- RNN + LSTM
- Customized `nn` modules

`mongoDB` Mgmt:

- Non-relational db for basic and timestamp info, raw timeseries, sample rate, features, spectrums, hidden states, etc
