### Analog
- Oscs
    - Blend the two ocs
    - Tune the second by semitones and cents (1/100 of a semi) 
    - Tune to create slight distortion and chord feeling
    - Vibrato, change amplitude
- Modulations: filters, LFOs, filter env, amplifier env 
    - Amplifier env, long attack make fade in for ambient
    - Glide is used to connect multi-notes, for building up or smooth trans
- Settings: Vel sensitivity
- Global: detune, stereo spread, voices(mono/poly/legato)
- Sync: master osc and slave osc, more complex sounding forms, the slave will follow up
